                <p>An was one of those rare students who constantly reminded me why 
                  I went back to teaching in the first place. Her problem-solving ability
                   and dedication to learning are incredible. She came into Hackbright Academy 
                   with some knowledge of basic Python and JavaScript syntax, and by the end of 
                   the course she had designed a sophisticated recommendation algorithm and 
                   taught herself Celery in less than a day. Her capstone project, Playdate Birdies, 
                   is one of the most impressive projects I have seen in nearly a year at Hackbright.
                    An has the intelligence and passion to go really far as a software engineer.</p>

                <p>An is a self-motivated, curious, and compassionate learner. When
                  learning new concepts, she isn't just content with understanding but
                  also immediately thinks of applications and limitations, leading her
                  to ask very interesting questions. During project season, she also
                  impressed me with her ability to learn and incorporate new
                  technologies in her project - she was even able to teach me a few
                  things! When she did run into issues and asked for help, she was
                  always able to explain her problem and her varied approaches to debug
                  in specific ways. Furthermore, An is also someone who can work well
                  under pressure and through extenuating circumstances - despite a
                  challenging personal situation that arose during the bootcamp, she was
                  able to complete her final project and demo and her project was chosen
                  as one of the ones to showcase to everyone at graduation. Above all,
                  even though she is extremely competent, An was always kind, patient,
                  and appreciative, making her a pleasure to work with. I would highly
                  recommend An for any role!.</p>

              <p>I knew when I met An that she would be going places! Even with the responsibility 
                as a mother with a small child, An was able to plan ahead and prepare so she 
                could have the best experience as a learner.   I believe An is a natural born leader!  
                In many situations, she was named as being the person who helped another through 
                solving a difficult problem, giving guidance and support. An has true grit and a 
                tenacity like no other.  Many times was faced with adversity and overcame by quickly 
                adapting and moving forward with solid planning skills.  An has self motivation and 
                has the ability to motivate others as well.  She solves difficult problems with grace!  
                Sometimes even making it look easy!  Iâ€™m really excited to see An grow in a new role 
                and career!  Where ever she lands, she will be an asset to the team and company!</p>

              <p>In only a few months, An has shown incredible skill and growth as a developer. 
                She represents the core tenets of what make a good software engineer: curious, 
                analytical, and persistent. She has readily taken on many challenges within her 
                projects to build new and unfamiliar features where no one that supported her knew 
                how to solve the problem. She has been successful every time and tackles these problems 
                with the mindset to learn. The results of these strong attributes in An are evident in
                 the quality of each project she builds, most noticeably her incredible Playdate Birdies 
                 project that goes beyond expectations. Working with her, I have been particularly impressed
                  by her organizational thinking and her ability to explain and debug.</p>
